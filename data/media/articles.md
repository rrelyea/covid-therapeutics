> Dr. Vivian Cheung takes steroids to manage a rare genetic disease. The drugs suppress her immune system, which puts her at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. It also means that her body didn't really make antibodies in response to two shots she got of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

> Cheung is a pediatrician and research scientist. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she flew weekly from her clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland to her lab at the University of Michigan. Now she hasn't been to her lab in two years. "Except for work, I don't go out at all," she says. "I haven't been inside of a grocery store for over a year."

- "We offer a guide to protecting the elderly, immunocompromised and unvaccinated from Covid."
> Many people don’t know Evusheld exists or don’t know how to find out if they’re eligible and how to get a shot.

> Rob Relyea, an engineer at Microsoft whose wife has cancer, has created [an online resource](https://rrelyea.github.io/evusheld/), in the absence of information from official sources. The country needs a “better communication plan around Evusheld,” Relyea tweeted. “Each hospital should proactively reach out to immunocompromised patients.”

> The confusion around Evusheld is another example of how the fragmented U.S. health care system harms people."

> Evusheld’s arrival in December immediately set off a scramble. In Facebook groups and online messages, patients and their loved ones began swapping information about how to get it. Government data sets about Evusheld’s availability were so complex and confusing that a software developer in the Seattle area, Rob Relyea, developed his own [mapping tool](https://rrelyea.github.io/evusheld/) that tracks how much of the drug is available and which providers have it.

> “People should know where to go to get in line,” he said.

> Mr. Relyea, 51, had a vested interest: His wife, Rebecca, is in remission from cancer. They tried 10 hospitals unsuccessfully but then got the drug through luck, as Ms. Relyea’s name was picked in a lottery for Evusheld at a hospital near their home in early February, he said.

> But they have not heard anything yet about scheduling a second dose, which Ms. Relyea needs based on the new recommendations.

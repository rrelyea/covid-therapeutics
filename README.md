# Where does this data comes from?
HealthData.gov collects all medical facilities with Evusheld orders/inventory and publishes it to https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Public-Therapeutic-Locator/rxn6-qnx8

Every 20 minutes, this site:
- seperates each therapeutic into its own file
- sorts it by state, county, city, providerName
- saves latest version to CSV file in [https://github.com/rrelyea/covid-therapeutics/tree/main/data/therapeutics](/data/therapeutics)

HealthData.gov has been updating the data feed daily.
